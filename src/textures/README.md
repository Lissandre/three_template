# TEXTURES

By placing your texture here (.jpg, .jpeg or .png), it will be automatically imported in your project.
The name of your file will be used to name the variable that will contains your texture.

Example:
With a file `./background.jpg`, you can access your model with `this.textures.background`

You can also organize your textures with different directories.
For example, `./textures/any/path/to/background.jpg` find its access with `this.textures.any.path.to.background`
